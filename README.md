# 🎹 The Tightening

> **From any key to the right key**

A revolutionary piano learning app that lets you play the melody from day one. No frustration. No wrong notes. Just gradual, natural improvement through adaptive key mapping and audio feedback.

## 🎯 The Big Idea

Traditional piano learning: **"You pressed the wrong key. Try again."**

The Tightening: **"Great! You played the melody. Now let's make it sound even better."**

### How It Works

1. **Phase 1 - Complete Freedom** (Day 1)
   - Press **ANY key** on your MIDI keyboard
   - It plays the correct melody note
   - You're playing Canon in D from minute one!

2. **Phase 2 - Gentle Guidance** (Weeks 1-4)
   - Wrong keys still play the melody
   - But they sound slightly off (detuned, different timbre, quieter)
   - Correct keys sound perfect
   - Your brain naturally gravitates toward better-sounding keys

3. **Phase 3 - Mastery** (Month 2+)
   - Distribution has tightened to correct keys only
   - You're playing the actual song correctly
   - You learned without frustration

## 🧠 The Science

**Adaptive Key Mapping** using Gaussian probability distributions:

```
accuracy = e^(-distance² / (2σ²))
```

- **Initially**: σ = 44 semitones → all 88 keys work equally
- **Progressively**: σ gradually decreases based on your performance
- **Finally**: σ = 0.5 semitones → only correct keys sound good

**Audio Feedback** with three tunable mechanisms:
- **Detuning**: ±50 cents pitch shift for wrong keys
- **Timbre**: Low-pass filter reduces brightness (10kHz → 500Hz)
- **Volume**: Up to 50% quieter for wrong keys

All parameters are **fully configurable** - we expect to iterate based on real use.

## ✨ Features

### Core
- 🎹 **Adaptive Key Mapping** - ANY key plays melody initially
- 🎵 **Accompaniment Mode** - Chord progressions play while you play melody
- 📊 **Confusion Matrix Tracking** - Hits, misses, extras (not just %)
- 🎮 **Guitar Hero Visualization** - Falling notes with distribution glow
- 🎛️ **Full Manual Control** - Override all auto-progression
- 🎤 **Lyrics Display** - Section names and lyrics for songs that have them

### Technical
- ⚡ **Low Latency** - <20ms MIDI, <50ms audio
- 🎨 **60fps Rendering** - Canvas + SVG visualizations
- 💾 **Progress Persistence** - LocalStorage save/load
- 🎚️ **Fully Tunable** - Single config file controls all behavior

### Current Songs
- Canon in D (Pachelbel)
- Hey Jude (The Beatles) - with section lyrics

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (latest LTS)
- **MIDI Keyboard** (tested with Akai MPK Mini 3)
- **Git**

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kenEldridge/the-tightening.git
cd the-tightening

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the app
npm run dev
```

The app will open in Electron. Click **Play** to start!

---

## 🎮 Usage

### First Time Setup
1. Connect your MIDI keyboard before opening the app
2. Click the **Play** button to initialize audio
3. Start playing any keys - you're playing Canon in D!

### Practice Controls
- **Play/Pause** - Control playback
- **Tempo Slider** - Adjust speed (40-200 BPM)
- **Distribution Width** - Manual difficulty control
- **Reference Volume** - Adjust background melody
- **Auto Progression** - Toggle automatic tightening

### Understanding the UI
- **Falling Notes** - Guitar Hero visualization showing upcoming notes
- **Distribution Glow** - Shows acceptable key range (tighter = harder)
- **Piano Keyboard** - Visual feedback with distribution gradient
- **Stats Dashboard** - Progress, accuracy, streaks, practice time

## ⚙️ Configuration

All behavior is controlled by `src/config/AppConfig.ts`:

```typescript
{
  distribution: {
    initialWidth: 44,      // All keys work
    finalWidth: 0.5,       // Only correct keys
    autoTighteningRate: 0.01
  },
  audioFeedback: {
    detuning: { enabled: true, maxCents: 50, weight: 0.4 },
    timbre: { enabled: true, filterReduction: 2000, weight: 0.3 },
    volume: { enabled: true, maxReduction: 0.5, weight: 0.3 }
  },
  progression: {
    autoMode: true,
    accuracyThreshold: 0.7  // 70% to trigger tightening
  }
}
```

See [CLAUDE.MD](./CLAUDE.MD) for complete configuration reference.

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Recently Fixed
- **Stale closure bug** - Same note playing every time (fixed with refs)
- **Audio degradation cliff** - Width=44 caused sudden quality drop (fixed)
- **Toy piano sound** - Replaced with smplr SplendidGrandPiano samples

## 🎼 The Name

**"The Tightening"** refers to the core mechanic: the gradual tightening of the probability distribution that guides learners from complete freedom to precise accuracy.

Chaos → Order. Any key → The right key.
